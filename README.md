# Gradescope-Utils

## NAME
EECS 490 Gradescope Utilities

## DESCRIPTION
Suite of scripts for gradescope stuff

Each file should contain its own documentation, which can be displayed by running `CMD --help`

Originally a port of
<https://github.com/eecs490/Assignment-8-Gradescope>
in W22

## OVERVIEW
### `gu` wrapper
- `gu --help` brings up this README
- `gu --list` lists all provided scripts
- `gu CMD ARGS` calls `bin/CMD ARGS`
(`~/.local/bin` should already be in `$PATH`, but you may need to add it)

#### examples
- `gu map.pl -f gu -f singletonkv2scalar.pl < submissions.json`

### bin
"types":

- **token2uniqname** is a json hash from (eg learn ocaml) tokens to uniqnames
- **submissions** is a json hash of student data, keyed by token

#### the main scripts, in approximate pipeline order:
##### join.pl : **zip** → [**token2uniqname**, **submissions**]
- stdin: n/a
- stdout: json pair of (**token2uniqname**, **submissions**)
- args: a Gradescope submissions export **zip**, and hooks to configure what ends up in **submissions**

##### split.pl : **token2uniqname** → **csv** → **submissions**
- stdin: **token2uniqname**
- stdout: **submissions**
- args: filepath to a **csv** (eg a sqlite dump),
and hooks to configure what ends up in **submissions**

comes with a wrapper to run each student in parallel, [`parallel.rb`](#parallelrb)

##### map.pl : **json hash** → **json hash**
- stdin: **json hash**
- stdout: **json hash** (with same keys)
- args: λ to run on each value

##### upload.pl : [**token2uniqname**, **submissions**] → ()
- stdin: json pair of (**token2uniqname**, **submissions**)
- stdout: debug messages
- args: Gradescope class and assignment ids

#### helper utilities/λs
see `gu --list`

### lib
TODO: document ./lib/

## GETTING STARTED

### preface
First, to address a common concern:
Yes, most of the scripts are written in Perl.
But Gradescope-Utils (hereafter GU) does *not* require familiarity with Perl.
The extensional behavior of each script should be clear enough that--
barring bonafide bugs--
you should never need to read the source.

Second, I realize this all seems rather complicated for a simple task.
But GU arose from a need.
Most scripts are half a terminal.
The job is just split over many files so each step is transparent,
and so you can see the data.
Moreover, the modularity allows you to plug in your own scripts as the need arises.
### installing
You don't *need* to install these scripts-- just `git clone` and relative path everything--,
but there is a convenience wrapper.

The two commands are
`make install`
or `make install-lite`.
This installs a wrapper `gu` to `~/.local/bin`.
See OVERVIEW.

`make install` builds everything, which requires **a lot** of dependencies.
You probably want to `make install-lite` which uses the included tarball.

You may need to install cpan modules as you go-- whenever you get the "you may need to install the FOO::BAR module" message.
`make install-runtime-deps` installs some of the runtime dependencies.
