=head1 NAME

EECS 490 Gradescope Utilities

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Collection of scripts for gradescope stuff

Each file should contain its own documentation

Below is just a overview

=head2 ./upload

scripts to upload to gradescope

originally a port of
https://github.com/eecs490/Assignment-8-Gradescope
during W22

=head3 Translate.pm

Handles token/uid â†¦ uniqname translation

A carryover from the scripts' origins w/ A8

Just make uid = uniqname if you don't actually need uid handling

=head3 gen_submissions.pl

Takes a single csv of all student data and parcels it up into individual student submissions for ./upload.pl

The single csv is from A8-- a sqlite dump

=head3 upload.pl

uploads all submissions output by ./gen_submissions.pl
(or in the correct format, since ./gen_submissions.pl is fairly A8 specific)
