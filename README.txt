NAME
       EECS 490 Gradescope Utilities

DESCRIPTION
       Collection of scripts for gradescope stuff

       Each file should contain its own documentation (the perl scripts will use POD,
       which can be read with perldoc, or "./script-name --help")

       Below is just an overview

       originally a port of <https://github.com/eecs490/Assignment-8-Gradescope>
       during W22

   bin
       The main scripts, in pipeline order:

       join.pl : zip -> (json, json)
           csv is single csv of all submissions

           returns a json pair, (token2uniqname, submissions), where submissions is
           keyed by token

           Intended for converting a Gradescope submissions export into json

       csv2json : csv -> json
           "Text::CSV" wrapper that converts csv to key-value

           Intended for converting a csv token2uniqname into json, as an initial step
           for split.pl

       split.pl : (json, csv) -> json
           Takes token2uniqname json and splits csv into json key-value, keyed by
           token

           Intended for processing a csv database dump

       map.pl : json -> json
           This is where ``the real" processing is hooked in

       upload.pl : (json, json) -> ()
           Takes a json pair, (token2uniqname, submissions), and uploads to
           Gradescope

       proj.pl : json -> json
           0-indexed json array projection

       bundled lambdas

       field-n-eq?.pl : TODO
           split.pl

       grep.pl : (json kv, regex) -> json kv
